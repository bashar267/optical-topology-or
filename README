Optical Topology OR — NSO Action Package
This NSO package provides:
    • Automatic optical topology discovery
    • SRG + DEG topology parsing
    • Media Channel / Network Media Channel auto-creation
    • Cross-connect creation & deletion
    • Full validation of frequency slots
    • Per-device connection auditing
The package works with any NETCONF OpenROADM agent, including your custom agent.

Features
✔ Topology Discovery
    • Extracts DEG / SRG numbers
    • Parses circuit-packs
    • Detects internal DEG↔SRG wiring
    • Builds operational topology in /optical-topology-or:optical-topology
✔ Build ROADM Connections
Supports:
    • DEG → DEG
    • DEG → SRG
    • SRG → DEG
    • SRG → SRG
Automatically creates required:
    • MC-TTP (for DEG only)
    • NMC-CTP interfaces
    • Roadm-connection entries
With validation:
    • No overlapping MC intervals
    • Frequency is mandatory
    • One endpoint is RX, one TX
✔ Smart Delete
Deleting a connection:
    • removes the associated roadm-connection
    • safely removes MC/NMC interfaces (only if unused)
    • protects OMS/OTS TTP interfaces
